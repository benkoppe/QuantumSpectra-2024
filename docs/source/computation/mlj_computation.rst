MLJ Computation
================================

.. note:: 
    This is a work in progress. This page is a stub, and needs to be completed.

This page will describe how the mlj model is computed, and provide acceptable parameter ranges.

This will describe how the MLJ model generates an absorption spectrum.

These docs aren't yet written! For now, read descriptions from the source docstrings:
