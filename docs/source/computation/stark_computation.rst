Stark Computation
===================================

.. note:: 
    This is a work in progress. This page is a stub, and needs to be completed.

This page will describe how the stark model is computed, and provide acceptable parameter ranges.

Electric Field Effects
-----------------------------------

This will describe how the Stark model generates a new absorption spectrum from the submodel's absorption spectrum and field effects.

These docs aren't yet written! For now, read descriptions from the source docstrings:
