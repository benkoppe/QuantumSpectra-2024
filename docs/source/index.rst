QuantumSpectra-2024 Documentation
===============================================

Welcome to the documentation for QuantumSpectra-2024, or **QS-2024** for short.

QS-2024 is a Python package for simulating the absorption spectra of donor-acceptor molecular systems.
A number of different models are implemented, all of which are based in quantum mechanical or semiclassical theory.

To get started, read the :doc:`insallation guide <startup/installation>`.
